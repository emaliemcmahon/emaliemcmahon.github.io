I  am a postdoc in the lab of Nancy Kanwisher at MIT. I recently defended my PhD in Computational Cognitive Science at Johns Hopkins under the supervision of Drs. Leyla Isik and Michael Bonner. Broadly, I am interested in visual perception and social cognition. I use a variety of methods including human behavior, neuroimaging (fMRI, intracranial recordings, and EEG), and computational modeling. 

Prior to JHU, I attended the University of Tennessee and was a research assistant with Leslie Ungerleider and Maryam Vaziri-Pashkam at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). 

In my free time, I enjoy cooking, running, and taking long walks with my husband and dog. I am also a hobby science fiction enthusiast and have brought that interest to a course that I taught in the winter of 2023 titled *Cognitive Science Fiction.*
