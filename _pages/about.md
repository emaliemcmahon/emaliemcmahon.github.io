I recenly defend my PhD in Computational Cognitive Science at Johns Hopkins under the supervision of Drs. Leyla Isik and Michael Bonner. Starting in January 2025, I will be a postdoc in the lab of Nancy Kanwisher at MIT. Broadly, I am interested in visual and social cognition. My PhD work has focused on social vision. In particular, my work has investigated how social visual features are organized in the human brain using fMRI, intracranial recordings, and EEG.  

Prior to JHU, I attend the University of Tennessee, Knoxville and was then a research assist with Leslie Ungerleider and Maryam Vaziri-Pashkam at NIMH. 

In my free time, I enjoy cooking, running, and long walks with my partner and dog. I am also a hobby science fiction enthusiast and have brought that interest to a course that I taught in winter 2023 titled "Cognitive Science Fiction."
