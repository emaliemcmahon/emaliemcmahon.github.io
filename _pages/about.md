I  am a postdoc in the lab of Nancy Kanwisher at MIT. I recenly defend my PhD in Computational Cognitive Science at Johns Hopkins under the supervision of Drs. Leyla Isik and Michael Bonner. Broadly, I am interested in visual perception and social cognition. I use a variety of methods including human behavior, neuroimaging (fMRI, intracranial recordings, and EEG), and computational modeling. 

Prior to JHU, I attend the University of Tennessee, Knoxville and was then a research assist with Leslie Ungerleider and Maryam Vaziri-Pashkam at NIMH. 

In my free time, I enjoy cooking, running, and long walks with my partner and dog. I am also a hobby science fiction enthusiast and have brought that interest to a course that I taught in winter 2023 titled "Cognitive Science Fiction."
